# Basic HTML Gmail replica
This is a project based on [Foundational HTML](http://www.foundationalhtml.com/) course. I built three static pages that replicate Gmail's interface : Inbox, Compose Mail and Email (first email, titled "Launched Foundational HTML").

## [See live demo here](http://my-basic-html-gmail.glitch.me/).
For a seamless experience, I recommend using Google Chrome.
